# 📊 Amazon Product Review Dashboard

This project explores and visualizes Amazon product review data using Excel.  
It provides insights into customer satisfaction, discount strategies, and product performance across categories.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal is to practice end-to-end data analysis by:
- Cleaning messy product and review data
- Creating calculated columns (e.g., discounts, buckets)
- Building pivot tables and a clean, interactive Excel dashboard
- Drawing actionable business insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & KPIs
- Basic Formulas (IF, TEXT functions, COUNTIF, etc.)
- (Optional: Flash Fill, Power Query)

---

## 📊 Key Features in the Dashboard

- **Top KPIs**: Total products, average rating, discount percentage, total reviews
- **Visuals**:
  - Average discount % by product category
  - Top 5 highest-rated products
  - Total reviews per category
  - Scatter plot: discount vs rating
- **Clean layout** with consistent formatting and labels

---

## 📈 Insights & Takeaways

- Products generally have strong average ratings (4.18+)
- Discounts vary significantly by category, especially in fashion
- Customer engagement is highest in electronics and home appliances
- No strong correlation between discounts and product ratings (R² = 0.0242)

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- Promote top-rated products to increase conversions
- Focus on quality more than discounts — as discounts don’t improve ratings
- Identify underperforming categories for improvement or repositioning
